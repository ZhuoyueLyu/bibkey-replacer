# bibkey-replacer
 A Python script that replaces old citation keys in LaTeX files (\cite{...}) using new BibTeX keys. Useful when converting an Overleaf LaTeX project that uses manual or numeric citation keys into one managed by a reference manager like Zotero. This script updates (almost) all the keys automatically.
